# Effective Rates for the Top 20 U.S. Import Origins

Announced country-level tariffs can be misleading. The U.S. tariff system includes a complex web of product-specific exceptions and overriding tariffs (such as Section 232 measures).

To capture the true tariff burden, we calculate trade-weighted effective tariff rates at the HS 8-digit level, weighted by 2024 import values. This approach accounts for the actual composition of each country's exports to the United States.

For a complete breakdown of the methodology and assumptions, please see the methodological note. Full data for all countries are available on our website.

# Relative Trump Tariff Advantage for the Top 20 U.S. Import Origins

A country's own effective tariff rate tells only half the story. The critical question is: How does this rate compare to what competitors pay?

We define **relative tariff advantage** as the comparison between a jurisdiction's own trade-weighted tariff and the average rate faced by competitors on the same products.

- **Positive value (advantage):** The country faces lower tariffs than its rivals, making it more price-competitive in the U.S. market.
- **Negative value (disadvantage):** The country is taxed more heavily than its competitors.

This metric reveals the winners and losers under the new tariff regime.

# Relative Trump Tariff Advantage by Import Origin & Top Products

Country averages mask substantial product-level variation. Individual export products experience vastly different competitive effects depending on:

- The specific mix of competitors
- The applicable tariff rules for each product

Notably, competing primarily against Chinese exporters often creates advantages, as China faces higher tariffs. In contrast, competing against USMCA partners (Canada and Mexico) or other favored nations typically creates disadvantages.

# Hypothetical Revenues by Import Origin

**Important disclaimer:** This is NOT a forecast of future government revenue.

This analysis is a thought experiment answering: "If the 2024 trade year repeated exactly under the new tariffs, which countries would generate the most revenue?"

In practice, trade flows would shift significantly in response to tariff changes. However, this calculation isolates the direct, first-order fiscal impact, free from behavioral adjustments.

**Methodology:** We apply the new final tariff rates to historical 2024 import values for every product (HS 8-digit level).
